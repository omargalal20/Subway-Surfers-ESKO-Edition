Warp Door (Super Mario World) from Super Mario Maker

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D.


Info:
I made this for the sake of a diorama for one of my Super Mario Maker courses.
You can remove the doorknobs to make it look more like the original Super Mario World doors.
